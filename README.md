## Python Inheritance

Today we'll use the PRIMM method for learning programming to learn more about inheritance in Python.

We'll work with:

- a parent class
- a child class
- the `super()` function

The `super()` function will be added to our child class.

REMEMBER: The word **super** in the `super()` function refers to the **super**class (AKA the **parent** class).
